# arch-setup

This is my version of a dumbed down `Omakub` setup script. It's meant to be ran on a `CachyOS` (or `arch`) install with the base `Gnome` packages installed.

This is open-sourced just for the sake of being able to install this on any machine without logging in into Github. It's absolutely customized for me and I don't recommend anyone else to install it.

Use it as an inspiration for your own install script.

## Install

```
eval "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfranciscosousa/arch-setup/refs/heads/master/boot.sh)"
```
